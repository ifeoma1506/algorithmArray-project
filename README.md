This project contains solutions for two problems:

Problem 1: Sum of Distinct Elements
Given two sets of integers, the algorithm finds and sums all distinct elements that appear in only one of the sets.

Problem 2: Dot Product & Orthogonality Check
The dot_product function computes the scalar (dot) product of two vectors.
The check_orthogonality function determines whether given pairs of vectors are orthogonal by using the dot_product function.

Usage
Modify set1 and set2 in the script to compute the sum of distinct elements.
Modify vectors to check orthogonality for different vector pairs.
